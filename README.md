# Description
This program was made as a training.

## Technical task
Write a console program in Java that sorts the text submitted to it on the standard input alphabetically.

**Variants of complication:**
1. The program should ignore the register when sorting.
2. The program should sort not alphabetically, but by the number of characters in the string.
3. The program as an argument can get the ordinal number of the word in the line on which you want to sort the lines.
